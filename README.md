## Design
    Game Funcation
        * Run Error free
        * Player can not move off screen
        * Vehicles cross the screen
        * Vehicle-player collisions happen logically (not too early or too late)
        * Vehicle-player collision resets the game
        * Something happens when player wins

    Object-Oriented Code
        * Game objects (player and vehicles) are implemented using JavaScript object-oriented programming features.

    Documentation
        * Include a read me
        * Comments are present and effectively explain longer code procedures. As a rule of thumb: describe what all custom functions and object methods do.
        * Code is formatted with consistent, logical, and easy-to-read formatting as described in the Udacity JavaScript Style Guide.

## Comments
    I did not like this project.  I am not a gamer and I had a hard time understanding the flow of the program since most of the heavy lifting was done by the engine that was provided.  I tried hard to at least code it using the OO techniques.
